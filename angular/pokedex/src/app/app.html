<!-- 
    The double curly brackets below are used to tell Angular we want to display whatever property or function result that is referenced
    in the template statement. For the examples below we are telling Angular to display as text content the values of the referenced
    fields
-->
<h1> {{headerText}} </h1>
<p> {{searchInstructions}} </p>
<!-- 
    the type attribute wrapped in square brackets is property binding: we are telling Angular we want to set the value of the type attribute
    via code in our component class. This allows us to determine the value of the attribute within our component class and dynamically
    update it if needed
-->
<input [type]="searchType" [placeholder]="placeholderText" >
<button>{{buttonText}}</button>

<h2>{{pokemonName()}}</h2>

<!-- we will use this later -->
<router-outlet />
