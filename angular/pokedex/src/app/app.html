<!-- 
    The double curly brackets below are used to tell Angular we want to display whatever property or function result that is referenced
    in the template statement. For the examples below we are telling Angular to display as text content the values of the referenced
    fields
-->
<h1> {{headerText}} </h1>
<p> {{searchInstructions}} </p>
<!-- 
    the type attribute wrapped in square brackets is property binding: we are telling Angular we want to set the value of the type attribute
    via code in our component class. This allows us to determine the value of the attribute within our component class and dynamically
    update it if needed

    note that ngModel (which we get access to via the FormsModule imported in the component) has square and parenthesis around it: this
    represents two way data binding. Any time the pokemonIdentifier or value of the input changes, the change is reflected in the other
    resource. In essence, the value of the input and the value of the variable are connected

    for the button, we are telling angular we want to bind the execution of the updateDisplayedPokemonName function with the click event
    on the button. This is a much easier syntax to use than manually setting an event listener
-->
<input [type]="searchType" [placeholder]="placeholderText" [(ngModel)]="pokemonIdentifier">
<button (click)="updateDisplayedPokemonName()">{{buttonText}}</button>

<h2>{{pokemonName()}}</h2>

<app-poke-name></app-poke-name>

<!-- we will use this later -->
<router-outlet />
