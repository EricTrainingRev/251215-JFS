<!-- 
    Starting in Angular 17 the formatting for structural directives changed: it used to be you
    would use syntax in a tag to provide the logic for how content would render on the page. Now, the
    modern way of controlling the rendering logic is to use the @ and then a standard control flow
    statement, much like if you were writing standard JavaScript. The Angular engine knows how to
    convert this syntax into executable JavaScript code.
-->
@if (false) {
    <!-- 
        The double curly brackets below are used to tell Angular we want to display whatever property or function result that is referenced
        in the template statement. For the examples below we are telling Angular to display as text content the values of the referenced
        fields
    -->
    <h1> {{headerText}} </h1>
    <p> {{searchInstructions}} </p>
    <!-- 
        the type attribute wrapped in square brackets is property binding: we are telling Angular we want to set the value of the type attribute
        via code in our component class. This allows us to determine the value of the attribute within our component class and dynamically
        update it if needed

        note that ngModel (which we get access to via the FormsModule imported in the component) has square and parenthesis around it: this
        represents two way data binding. Any time the pokemonIdentifier or value of the input changes, the change is reflected in the other
        resource. In essence, the value of the input and the value of the variable are connected

        for the button, we are telling angular we want to bind the execution of the updateDisplayedPokemonName function with the click event
        on the button. This is a much easier syntax to use than manually setting an event listener
    -->
    <input [type]="searchType" [placeholder]="placeholderText" [(ngModel)]="pokemonIdentifier">
    <button (click)="updateDisplayedPokemonName()">{{buttonText}}</button>

    <h2>{{pokemonName()}}</h2>

        One way to update your router-outlet is through a hyperlink. Instead of using the standard
        href attribute you use the routerLink attribute
