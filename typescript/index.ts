/*
    If you want to execute your code with node you simply reference it after the node command. Keep
    in mind if working with ts you can't directly execute your ts code: you must first use the
    TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile your code from ts into js, then you can execute it

    step 1 -> write your TypeScript code
    step 2 -> compile your TypeScript code using npx tsc
    step 3 -> execute your newly compiled JavaScript code
