        JavaScript is a weakly and dynamically typed programming language
        - weakly typed -> types are not set in stone: the interpreter will sometimes coerce values
                          into a new type in order for the code to execute
        - dynamically typed -> you don't have to declare the type of your variables when you create
                               them

        It is an interpreted language, meaning the JS interpreter goes line by line compiling and 
        executing your code from the start of your script to the end of your script

        The language supports multiple programming paradigms such as Object Oriented Programming
        and Functional programming

    // old way to create variables: the variable is hoisted, so the code below is valid
    var myVariable = "Whatever the value is";
    console.log(whatIsThis); // prints undefined
    var whatIsThis; // this variable is hoisted
    whatIsThis = "Actual value"; // value is finally assigned

    
    // the modern way of creating variables: use let for dynamic values, const for constant values
    let valueChanges;
    console.log(valueChanges); // will show undefined
    valueChanges = "Something";
    console.log(valueChanges) // will show Something
    valueChanges = "Something new";
    console.log(valueChanges) // will show Something new

    const PI = 3.14;
    console.log(PI) // will show 3.14
    // PI = 4.15; will cause your code to crash
