    <!-- 
        To make our web pages look good we can use Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in order to style
        our pages. There are three ways we can add styling to our page
        - inline -> editing the style attribute of an element directly in the tag
        - internal -> adding a style element to the head to apply styling to the entire page
        - external -> linking css from an external style sheet to the page
    -->
    <h1 style="color:red;">This has inline styling</h1>
    <h2>This has internal styling</h2>
    <h3>This has external styling</h3>

    <!-- 
        All elements on a page fit within the "box model". They all have access to the following:
        - Margin -> space between the element and the next element
        - Border -> the boundary surrounding the element
        - Padding -> the space between the element and its border
        - Content -> the stuff of the element itself
    -->

    <!-- 
        In the example below, the first input wants 5 pixels between it and whatever elements render to its right in the viewport,
        whereas the second input wants 15 pixels between it and elements that render to its left in the viewport. 15 is larger than 5,
        so in this case the distance between the elements will be 15 pixels
    -->
    <input type="text" value="first input" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-top: 20px">
    <input type="text" value="second input" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">


    <!-- 
        So far we have used tag selectors to apply styling to all elements of a type, but what if we need to apply styling to some
        elements of a type and different styling to other elements of that same type? In these cases we can make use of class and
        id selectors. When applying styling to elements, we can target elements for styling by their attributes (css selector). Two
        common attributes to use for targeting are classes and ids, so these have their own unique way of being targeted
