        Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is THE standard for web development. Browsers can take
        the HTML you create and use it to render content in the browser. All HTML is built using
        tags: these are text blocks between diamond brackets (<>), some of which are singular tags
        and others that have open and closing tags.

        Some core HTML tags:
        - html tags: root tag of the page
        - head tags: this section stores meta data about the page
        - body tags: this is where the content of the page lives
    -->
