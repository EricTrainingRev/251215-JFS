            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is THE standard for web development. Browsers can take
            the HTML you create and use it to render content in the browser. All HTML is built using
            tags: these are text blocks between diamond brackets (<>), some of which are singular tags
            and others that have open and closing tags.

            Some core HTML tags:
            - html tags: root tag of the page
            - head tags: this section stores meta data about the page
            - body tags: this is where the content of the page lives
        -->

        <!-- 
            Header elements are used to create titles or banners for sections of your web page. h1 is the largest of these
            headers, h6 is the smallest, smaller even than regular text appears on the page (useful for sub headers, subtext, that
            kind of thing)
        -->
        <h1>This is my example HTML page</h1>
        <h3>This is a sub header for my HTML page</h3>
        <h6>This is really small text on my HTML page</h6>
        this is raw text on the page
        
        <!-- 
            While you can put text content directly in the body element it is not ideal: a more standardized way of adding text
            is to wrap it inside of a p element. This will make standardizing and customizing the styling on your page much easier
            in the long run
        -->
        <p>This is an example of the paragraph element and its text</p>

        <!--  
            If you want to add an image to your page you can use the img tag. This takes in a src which is either the path to the 
            image locally or web link for where the image exists, and an alt value to display if something goes wrong trying to load
            the image

            NOTE: the src attribute is not case sensitive
        -->
        <img src="Dom-Visual.png" alt="dom visualization">
        <img src="Dom-Visual.pngg" alt="dom visualization">

        <!-- 
            We have a few examples now of tags, elements, and attributes:
            - Elements -> these are the individual components of your web page. They are created by adding tags to your html file, or
                          dynamically created via JavaScript
            - Tags ->     These are the markup text we use to tell the browser what content (aka elements) to render in the browser
            - attributes -> these are the properties of our elements that augment the way the browser renders them. They can also be used
                            to provide functionality to our elements
        -->

        <!-- 
            There are two core types of lists you can create: ordered and unordered. The key difference is whether or not the order of
            elements matters. Both types of lists utilize the same child element: list item (li)
        -->

        <!-- use ordered lists when you want to indicate the order of elements matters -->
        <p>Favorite Animals</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cat</li>
            <li>Dog</li>
            <li>Dragon</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- if order does not matter but you want things grouped in a list use an unordered list (ul) -->
         <p>Grocery List</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Bananas</li>
            <li>Beef</li>
            <li>Soap</li>
         </ul>

        <!-- 
            If you want to create a dropdown list and allow users to select one or more options you use a select element with nested
            option elements
        -->
        <select name="rpgClassSelector" id="rpgClassSelector">
            <option value="">Choose class</option>
            <option value="class_one">Rogue</option>

        </select>

        <p>What is the employee role?</p>
        <select name="" id="">
            <option value="actionFriend">add friend</option>
            <option value="actionremove">remove friend</option>
